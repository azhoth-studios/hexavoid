# Hexavoid
- Game jam project made for 2021 Epic MegaJam.
- It is made in Unreal Engine 4 using Blueprint (Used blueprint instead of C++ to cut down compile times and meet the deadline for the game jam).

## Gameplay Instructions
- Shoot the tiles below enemies to defeat them (you can not damage enemies by shooting directly) while keeping the damage to the area minimum.
- At the end of stage, you can choose between earning credits and repairing all tiles.
- After that, you may buy weapons, skills and upgrades with the credits you have.
- Ammunition refills at the end of each stage. Game becomes harder when you advance in stages. 
- Follow your progression from the 3D screen on the arena.

## Gameplay Controls
- WASD to move the character
- Mouse to look around, left click for shooting with current weapon, right click for detonating sticky bombs.
- Space to jump, space again to double jump (only after buying the upgrade).
- Left shift to dash (only after buying the upgrade).
- Escape for pause menu.
- Mouse wheel for changing weapons.

## Content that is not created by us
Most of the art, music and sound is outsourced because we do not have any artists or musicians in our team. I can only share the blueprint because I do not have the rights to redistribute the assets. There is a gameplay footage below in the README and also a playable release in the GitHub page.

## Why there are so few commits
We used PlasticSCM as version control because it works really well with Unreal Engine and handles large binary files better than git without the need for something like LFS. Then, we uploaded the project's final form to the GitHub to make it accessible for everyone.
